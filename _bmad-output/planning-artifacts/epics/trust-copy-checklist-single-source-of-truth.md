**Required statements (where relevant):**
- Participation is optional and consequence-free.
- No behavioural tracking; no manager visibility.
- What we store / what we do not store is explained in plain language.

**Forbidden patterns (must not appear):**
- Any “obligation” framing: “required”, “must”, “expected”, “mandatory”, “compliance”, “attendance”.
- Any surveillance framing: “tracked”, “monitoring”, “engagement”, “adoption”, “participation rate”, “performance”.
- Any gamification framing: “streak”, “leaderboard”, “score”, “points”.

**Tone rules (testable):**
