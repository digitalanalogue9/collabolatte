# Pre-mortem Risk Summary

**Failure scenario (6 months later):** Adoption fizzled, matches became irregular, trust wobbled, and participation quietly declined.

**Likely causes and prevention (by epic):**

### Epic 1: Join & Trust
- Cause: Join felt like HR compliance; transparency link buried or too legalistic
- Prevention: Keep join copy human and explicit; surface "What we store" in the primary flow

### Epic 2: Get Matched
- Cause: Cadence drifted; repeat matches happened too soon
- Prevention: Hard-log cycle runs with visible cadence; enforce repeat-avoidance window

### Epic 3: Have the Conversation
- Cause: Notification copy too generic; Teams link unreliable
- Prevention: Treat notification copy as core UX; validate Teams link generation

### Epic 4: Stay Opted-In
- Cause: Pause hidden; return felt cold
- Prevention: Make pause/leave explicit; include "welcome back" tone without reminders

### Epic 5: Operate Safely
- Cause: Metrics pressure led to dashboard creep; small cohorts exposed individuals
- Prevention: Enforce minimum-N; keep ops to system health + controls only
