# Deferred / Post‑MVP (Not in Epics)

- FR19: Conversation starter selection (post‑MVP conversation support)
- FR20: Reminder per match cycle (not in MVP; risks obligation)

Rule: these items remain explicitly out of MVP scope unless re-approved; they must not appear implicitly as “small enhancements” because they can erode the anti-mandate trust contract.
