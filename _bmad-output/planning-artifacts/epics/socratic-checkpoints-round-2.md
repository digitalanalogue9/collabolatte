# Socratic Checkpoints (Round 2)

1. If Epic 4 never shipped, would the system still feel voluntary?
   - It would feel less safe; pause/leave is essential to voluntariness.
2. Is "Have the Conversation" its own outcome or just a notification detail?
   - It is its own outcome; invitation design directly affects action.
3. What happens if admins demand "just a small dashboard"?
   - Trust posture changes; treat as Growth, not MVP.
4. What is the minimal truthful promise in the join copy?
   - "Opt-in, no tracking, no consequences if you ignore."
5. What is the smallest irreversible harm?
   - Any exposure of individual participation or match history to hierarchy.
