# Implementation Sequencing (Reasoning via Planning)

**Phase 0 - Foundations (Story 1.0)**

- Scaffold repo + SWA config + auth wiring + storage placeholders
- Outcome: devs can run web/api locally and deploy a thin skeleton

**Phase 1 - Join & Trust (Stories 1.1-1.6)**

- First contact trust surface
- Entra auth flow
- What-we-store transparency
- One-click join
- Leave/pause clarity at join
- Default participant role
- Outcome: users can safely opt in and trust the system

**Phase 2 - Get Matched (Stories 2.1-2.7)**

- Inclusion in cycle
- Cadence visibility
- Matching logic (random)
- Repeat avoidance + odd handling with calm notice
- Future algorithm configurability
- Non-participation handled silently
- Failures do not leak
- Outcome: the ritual runs without user effort

**Phase 3 - Have the Conversation (Stories 3.1-3.4)**

- Essential match email
- First-move prompt
- Teams deep link
- Silence acceptable
- Outcome: low-pressure invite delivered

**Phase 4 - Stay Opted-In (Stories 4.1-4.5)**

- Participation status
- Pause next cycle
- Leave mid-cycle handling
- Calm confirmations
- Minimal history
- Outcome: voluntary loop stays safe

**Phase 5 - Operate Safely (Stories 5.1-5.8)**

- Single programme config
- Invites
- Deactivate
- Role assignment
- Aggregate-only visibility
- Cycle completion notice
- Privacy controls
- System-event logs
- Outcome: hands-off operations with trust guardrails
