# Stakeholder Round Table Summary

**PM (Outcome clarity):**
- Epic 1 delivers value when opt-in is safe and obvious; avoid extra fields
- Epic 2 must stay "random + repeat-avoidance" to remain MVP
- Epic 5 must remain ops-only; keep FR29a Growth visible

**Architect (Dependency hygiene):**
- Epic 3 depends on Epic 2; keep it strictly downstream of match records
- Epic 4 should not introduce analytics tables or metrics surfaces
- Keep data writes scoped per epic to avoid coupling

**UX (Trust-first experience):**
- "Have the Conversation" must feel like a gentle invite, not a push
- "Stay Opted-In" should be one-click with calm microcopy
- Avoid multi-programme UI elements in MVP screens
