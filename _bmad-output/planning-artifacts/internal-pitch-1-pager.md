# Collabolatte: Internal Pilot Proposal

**Proposal from:** [Your Name]
**Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Seeking permission to run a small pilot

---

## The Problem

In large organisations, valuable conversations never happen. Not because people lack goodwill, but because:

- **Scale kills serendipity** — you don't know who to reach
- **Cold outreach feels awkward** — initiating without context is uncomfortable
- **No shared excuse to meet** — there's no natural reason to connect cross-team

New joiners struggle to build networks once onboarding energy fades. Hybrid workers see weak ties decay fastest. Ideas stay local, duplication persists, and the organisation feels more fragmented than it needs to be.

---

## The Proposal

**Collabolatte** is a lightweight, opt-in matching tool that periodically pairs colleagues across team boundaries for a coffee chat.

- **System initiates** — no one has to make the awkward first move
- **Low stakes** — if you miss a cycle, nothing happens
- **No surveillance** — we don't track whether you meet

**In one sentence:** A shared excuse to meet someone you wouldn't otherwise encounter.

## Why Not Use Existing Tools?

| Existing Tool | Problem |
|---------------|---------|
| Donut, RandomCoffee, etc. | Built for HR metrics — dashboards, participation tracking, manager visibility |
| Mentoring programmes | High commitment, formal structure, often fades after launch |
| ERG events | Valuable but infrequent; doesn't create 1:1 connections |

**The difference:** Collabolatte is designed for *participants*, not *measurement*. No one is watching. That's why people might actually show up.

## What I'm Asking For

**Permission to run a small pilot** with 20-50 volunteers across [target departments/teams].

| Resource | What's Needed | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Time** | Build on personal time / [20% time if applicable] | Minimal work-hour impact |
| **Azure hosting** | ~£10-20/month | I can cover personally if needed |
| **IT support** | Entra ID app registration | One-time setup, standard process |
| **HR awareness** | Not asking for promotion, just no objection | Optional co-sponsorship welcome |

**I'm not asking for budget, headcount, or a formal programme.**

---

## What Success Looks Like

After 2-3 monthly cycles:

| Signal | Measure |
|--------|---------|
| Cycles run reliably | 2–3 cycles complete on schedule |
| Notifications deliver | Delivery failures are visible and recoverable (no silent errors) |
| Trust preserved | Zero concerns about pressure or surveillance |
| Value emerges | A small handful of unprompted anecdotes (not tracked by the system) |

**Success is quiet.** If it's working, people just... keep doing it.

---

## What If It Fails?

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| No one signs up | Shut down, delete data, lesson learned |
| People sign up but don't meet | Shut down or adjust cadence |
| Complaints about time waste | Shut down immediately |
| IT/HR concerns emerge | Pause and address before continuing |

**Exit is easy.** This is a lightweight experiment, not a platform commitment.

- No long-term contracts
- No vendor lock-in
- No data retained beyond what participants see
- Complete shutdown takes one afternoon

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Data privacy** | Minimal data (name, email, department). No tracking of meetings. GDPR-aligned by design. |
| **Shadow IT** | Seeking explicit permission; happy to register formally with IT |
| **HR territory** | Not replacing existing initiatives; complementary and opt-in |
| **Time distraction** | Built on personal time; pilot management is lightweight |
| **Reputational** | Opt-in only; no forced participation; easy exit |

---

## The Research Behind It

This isn't just a hunch. The concept is grounded in:

- **Granovetter's "Strength of Weak Ties"** (1973) — weak connections provide novel information
- **Burt's "Structural Holes"** — people bridging groups drive innovation
- **Post-pandemic workplace research** — hybrid work accelerates weak tie decay

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Approval** | 1-2 weeks | This conversation |
| **Setup** | 2-3 weeks | Build and deploy (already designed) |
| **Pilot** | 2-3 months | 2-3 matching cycles with volunteers |
| **Decision** | After pilot | Continue, expand, or shut down |

---

## The Ask (Summary)

> "Can I run a small, opt-in pilot to see if this helps people connect across teams? I'll build it on my own time, it costs almost nothing, and if it doesn't work, we shut it down with no consequences."

## Questions?

Happy to discuss:

- Technical approach
- Privacy safeguards
- How participants would experience it
- What happens with the data
- How we'd know if it's working
