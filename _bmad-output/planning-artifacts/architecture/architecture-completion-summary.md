### Implementation Handoff

**For AI Agents:**
This architecture document is your complete guide for implementing collabolatte. Follow all decisions, patterns, and structures exactly as documented.

**First Implementation Priority:**
Initialise the monorepo structure + scaffolding per starter decisions.

**Development Sequence:**

1. Initialise project using documented starter template
2. Set up development environment per architecture
3. Implement core architectural foundations
4. Build features following established patterns
5. Maintain consistency with documented rules
