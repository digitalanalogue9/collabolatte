# Executive Summary

This research evaluates whether lightweight, opt-in internal connection mechanisms (for example curiosity coffees or random pairings) can generate early, measurable value in large multinational corporates where organizational distance suppresses natural interaction. The evidence base strongly supports the mechanism: weak ties act as bridges across groups, enabling access to non-redundant information and broader perspective. Hybrid and distributed work further reduce weak ties, indicating a need for deliberate, low-friction connection rituals if organizations want cross-boundary contact to persist. Regulatory requirements do not prohibit such programs, but they do impose obligations for lawful basis, transparency, and data minimization, especially across borders.

Key conclusion: The hypothesis is plausible and evidence-aligned at the mechanism level, but validation should focus on near-term signals (opt-in persistence, cross-boundary connections formed, self-reported learning/value), not long-cycle innovation metrics.

**Strategic Recommendations**
- Validate early value signals with minimal measurement: opt-in retention, cross-boundary tie formation, and short self-reported value prompts.
- Use privacy-by-design: data minimization, purpose limitation, and DPIA-style risk assessment for worker data.
- Preserve opt-in framing to reduce cultural resistance in conservative corporate environments.
