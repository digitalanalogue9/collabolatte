## Cross-Domain Synthesis
- Weak ties are central to cross-boundary information flow, which is the precise deficit in large matrixed organizations.

- Hybrid work measurably reduces weak ties, strengthening the case for deliberate, lightweight connection rituals.

## Strategic Opportunities
- Use opt-in rituals to generate weak ties without high coordination overhead.
- Validate with early indicators rather than performance metrics, preserving trust and adoption.
