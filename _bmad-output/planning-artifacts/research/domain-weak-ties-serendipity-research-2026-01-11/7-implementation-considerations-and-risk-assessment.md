# 7. Implementation Considerations and Risk Assessment

## Implementation Considerations
- Use data minimization and purpose limitation for participation data.
- Provide clear participant notice and avoid performance-evaluation reuse.
- Run a DPIA or equivalent assessment where risk thresholds apply.

## Risk Assessment
Primary risks include repurposing participation data for monitoring, insufficient transparency, and cross-border transfer non-compliance. These are manageable with privacy-by-design controls and careful program framing.
