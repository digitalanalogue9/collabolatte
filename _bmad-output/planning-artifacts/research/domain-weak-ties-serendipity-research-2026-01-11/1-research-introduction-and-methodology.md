# 1. Research Introduction and Methodology

## Research Significance

Weak ties are the bridges that move information across groups; they provide access to non-redundant information and are central to diffusion and opportunity. This is precisely the gap in large multinational corporates where organizational distance suppresses incidental interaction.

## Research Methodology

- Scope: weak ties, opt-in internal connections, organizational distance, and early-signal validation
- Sources: peer-reviewed research on weak ties and innovation, hybrid work effects, and official regulatory guidance
- Verification: all factual claims are grounded in public sources; inferences are labeled as such

## Research Goals and Objectives

**Original Goals:** Validate early value signals; assess early emergence of ideas/introductions; identify minimal-measurement success signals; understand failure modes; examine cadence/group size/opt-in effects; assess weak tie and serendipity evidence.

**Achieved Objectives:**

- Mechanism plausibility established via weak-tie and structural-hole literature.
