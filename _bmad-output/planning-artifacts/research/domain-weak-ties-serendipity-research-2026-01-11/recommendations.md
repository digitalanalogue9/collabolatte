# Recommendations

## Technology Adoption Strategy

Prioritize privacy-preserving analytics (ego-network aggregation and careful abstraction) if any measurement is required, and limit collection to participation and connection-level signals that avoid individual performance inference.

## Innovation Roadmap

Treat lightweight connections as an enabling layer for weak-tie formation and structural-hole bridging. This is consistent with evidence that weak ties and structural holes relate to more radical or novel innovation outcomes.

## Risk Mitigation

Apply privacy risk assessment for network data exposure, especially when network information extends beyond ego-level data, due to documented anonymity loss with distant connections.
