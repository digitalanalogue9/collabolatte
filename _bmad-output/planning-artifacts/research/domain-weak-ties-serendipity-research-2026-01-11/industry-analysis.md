# Industry Analysis

## Market Size and Valuation

There is no single, cleanly defined market for ?lightweight, opt-in internal connections.? The closest measurable proxies are adjacent markets for enterprise social networks (ESN), employee engagement software, and employee experience management. These figures indicate organisational spend on internal connection and engagement infrastructure, not proof of effectiveness for lightweight interventions.

- Enterprise social networks (ESN): USD 13.45B (2024), USD 15.75B (2025), forecast USD 29.33B (2029) with ~16.8% CAGR. Another summary cites USD 28.9B (2029) at ~16.6% CAGR, so treat the 2029 estimate as a tight range.
