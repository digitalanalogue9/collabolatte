# Executive Summary

The virtual coffee / employee matching market is established with 10+ active players, dominated by Slack-first solutions. Most competitors optimise for engagement metrics, analytics dashboards, and feedback collection. Collabolatte's trust-first, no-surveillance positioning is **distinct and defensible** — no direct competitor explicitly markets "no tracking, no manager visibility" as a core value proposition.

**Key Finding:** Collabolatte's differentiation depends on *not* adding features competitors have. The strategic risk is feature creep eroding the trust-first promise.
