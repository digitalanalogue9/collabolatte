### Journey 1: Tomás – The New Joiner's First Coffee

**Opening Scene:**

Tomás is three months into his graduate role. He works fully remote from Porto, reporting to a manager in London he's met twice on video. His team is friendly but small—four people, all in his time zone. He knows his immediate work, but the rest of the firm feels like a map with blank spaces.

He receives an email from HR about Collabolatte—"an opt-in way to meet people outside your team." It promises no tracking, no obligation, low stakes. He's curious. He clicks.

**Rising Action:**

The signup is trivial—his name, department, and location are pre-filled from the corporate directory (SSO integration). He clicks "Join." Done. No bio, no interests, no quiz.

Two weeks later, an email arrives: "You've been matched with **Samira, Principal Consultant, Singapore**." The email includes a simple first‑move prompt with suggested copy to help him reach out.

**Climax:**

They meet on Thursday. Samira is warm, curious, and asks him what it's like to join a firm remotely. Thirty minutes passes quickly. He learns that the firm has a whole sustainability practice he didn't know existed.

**Resolution:**

After the call, Tomás feels lighter. He didn't learn anything "useful" in a narrow sense—but he now knows a face, a name, a context. He stays opted in for the next cycle. The map has one fewer blank space.

### Journey 2: Marcus – The Sceptic Tests the Waters

**Opening Scene:**

Marcus is a senior engineer, four years at the firm, works hybrid from Manchester. He's seen HR initiatives come and go. When he hears about Collabolatte, his first instinct is suspicion. Is this another way to measure us?

He reads the fine print. Opt-in. No manager visibility. No feedback required. He clicks "Join" almost out of curiosity.

**Rising Action:**

His first match arrives: **Jess, Legal Counsel, London**. A lawyer? What would they even talk about?

The email includes a simple first‑move prompt with suggested copy. Marcus uses it and they schedule a call.

**Climax:**

The call is... fine. Not transformative. But the conversation starter gave them a thread to pull. They talk about how legal sees engineering requests, about the frustrations of working across departments. It's oddly humanising.

**Resolution:**

Marcus doesn't report anything. He simply stays opted in. The next month, he gets matched with someone in product—they realise they've been duplicating work and agree to share notes.

Marcus tells a colleague: "It's not a waste of time. Low stakes. Occasionally useful."
