# Success Criteria

### User Success

**Definition of "Worth It":**

A participant considers Collabolatte worthwhile when at least one of these occasionally happens, without high cost:

| Success Signal | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Learning** | Saw something new or a familiar problem from a different angle |
| **Connection** | Met someone they'd feel comfortable contacting again |
| **Context** | Gained insight into another team, client, market, or way of working |
| **Energy** | Had a genuine, human break that felt energising rather than draining |

**Key Insight:** It doesn't matter which of these happens—only that at least one occasionally does. The misses are acceptable if the cost stays low and the upside remains plausible.

**Proxy (MVP):** The system runs monthly without trust complaints or escalations, and occasional unprompted anecdotes of value emerge. Do not add participation metrics or dashboards in MVP.

### Business Success

**The Minimum Viable Narrative (6-month board story):**

> *"This creates value at low cost, without cultural backlash, and is worth continuing or modestly expanding."*

| Evidence Required | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Safe operation** | Cycles run on the agreed cadence; delivery failures are visible and recoverable |
| **Voluntary continuity (unmeasured)** | People keep opting in or returning without pressure, guilt loops, or metrics |
| **Credible anecdotes** | A small number of concrete stories: an introduction made, duplication avoided, work unblocked, or idea sparked |
| **Trust preserved** | No negative signals around surveillance, coercion, or time waste |

**What This Is Not:** ROI calculation. The narrative is credibility and optionality, not financial return.

### Technical Success

**The MVP Bar:**

| Criterion | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reliable delivery** | Matches generated and communicated on agreed cadence |
| **Boring predictability** | Auditable, unobtrusive, no surprises |
| **No surveillance feel** | No sense of monitoring, scoring, or judgement |
| **Graceful failure** | Ignoring it for a month has no consequence |
| **Easy exit** | Pause, leave, or forget without friction |

**Success Test:** If people keep turning up, nobody feels watched, and a few good stories emerge unprompted, the system is doing its job.

## Operational Outcomes (MVP)

In MVP, Collabolatte does **not** provide adoption/participation analytics. We prove safety and reliability with operational evidence only (gated behind **minimum‑N ≥5**):

- **Cycle execution health**: last run, next run, succeeded/failed.
- **Notification delivery health**: attempted/sent/failed (no recipient lists), retries exhausted.
- **Trust guardrails status**: minimum‑N enforcement, “no individual reporting” invariants, deletion pipeline health (queue size + oldest age).
- **Operational errors**: error category counts for the cycle and correlation IDs for investigation.
