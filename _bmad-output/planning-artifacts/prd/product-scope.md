# Product Scope

### MVP – Prove People Will Repeatedly Take the Shot

**Philosophy:** The thinnest possible slice that tests whether the core loop works. If the MVP can't succeed without a feature, the core hypothesis is probably wrong.

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Signup** | Minimal: name, function/department, location. No mandatory bio. |
| **Programme** | One public programme only |
| **Matching** | One matching rule (random or lightly constrained). No "better" matching—randomness is a feature, not a limitation. |
| **Notification** | Match notification with explicit "first move" prompt |
| **Cadence** | Clear, predictable timing |
| **Expected behaviour** | Meet or ignore, with no consequence |

**Explicitly Excluded from MVP:**

- Match expiry window (introduces edge cases and policy decisions too early)
- Quiet milestones (nice but not required to validate core loop)
- Multiple algorithms
- Profile customisation beyond basics

### Future Vision (post‑MVP, in order)

1. **Conversation support** – optional starters and gentle framing for first‑time matches.
2. **Safety valves** – one free pass per cycle; match expiry window.
3. **Programme flexibility** – additional programmes with clear purpose; controlled creation by trusted sponsors.
4. **Boundary shaping** – light constraints to encourage cross‑function/region matching.
5. **Growth mechanics** – gift a match; time‑boxed experiments.

### Scope Summary

| Tier | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **MVP** | Prove people will repeatedly take the shot |
| **Should-Have** | Reduce anxiety and social friction |
| **Post-MVP** | Expand surface area carefully |
| **Vision** | Keep private until behaviour is proven |
