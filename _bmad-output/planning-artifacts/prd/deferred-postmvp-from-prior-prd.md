# Deferred / Post‑MVP (from prior PRD)

### Deferred Notification Enhancements

- FR19 Conversation starter selection (post‑MVP conversation support)
- FR20 Reminder per match cycle (not in MVP; risks obligation)

These sections were removed from the MVP‑aligned PRD but preserved here for future phases.

### Journey 3: Priya – The Programme Creator Sets Conditions

**Opening Scene:**

Priya leads L&D in the UK practice. She's been asked to "do something about cross-team connection" without adding to anyone's workload.

She hears about Collabolatte. The promise: set it up, let it run safely, and avoid measuring people.

**Rising Action:**

Priya configures the programme: "UK Practice Coffee." She sets the cadence to monthly, match size to 1:1 pairs, and matching rule to random with repeat‑avoidance. She writes one line of copy: "Meet someone you wouldn't otherwise. No agenda. No follow‑up required."

She shares a simple join link. Volunteers opt in.

**Climax:**

After a couple of cycles, she checks the ops health: cycles ran, notifications delivered, and there were no trust escalations. She receives an unsolicited message from a senior partner: "I met someone in the Newcastle office I'd never have found otherwise."

**Resolution:**

Priya doesn't run Collabolatte—she set conditions and stepped back. When Helena asks for a board update, Priya says: "Monthly cycles ran, notification delivery was reliable, no complaints, and a handful of unprompted good stories."

*(In MVP, Priya sees ops‑only health signals (cycle execution, notification delivery health, trust guardrails status, and operational errors with correlation IDs) gated behind minimum‑N ≥5. No participation counts.)*

### Journey 4: Helena – The Executive Sponsor Defends the Investment

**Opening Scene:**

Helena is the CHRO. She approved the Collabolatte pilot because the pitch was low-cost, low-risk, and addressed a real problem.

**Rising Action:**

At the six-month mark, Priya sends a summary:

- The system ran predictably (monthly cycles completed as scheduled)
- Notification delivery remained reliable (failures were visible and fixed quickly)
- Trust posture held (no complaints, no escalations)
- Anecdotes emerged organically (a small handful of concrete stories)

**Climax:**

At the board meeting, a director asks: "What's the return on this?"

Helena says: "The return is optionality. We've created a low-cost mechanism for cross-team connection that people actually use, that hasn't created backlash, and that occasionally produces real value. It's infrastructure, not a programme."

**Resolution:**

The board nods. The pilot becomes permanent.

### Journey 5: Aisha – The Dormant User Returns

**Opening Scene:**

Aisha is a manager in Edinburgh, eight years at the firm. She joined Collabolatte early. Her first matches were fine, then forgettable. Then Q4 hit—deadlines, travel, no bandwidth. She ignored three match notifications. The system didn't chase her. No reminder. No "we miss you." Just silence.

By January, Collabolatte had slipped off her radar.

**Rising Action:**

In March, things slow down. She notices a match notification: **David, Operations Lead, Dublin**.

Aisha is about to lead a similar project. She copies the suggested first‑move message and sends it in Teams.

**Climax:**

David responds within an hour. They meet for 25 minutes. He tells her about the pitfalls—the vendor who overpromised, the comms plan that should have started earlier. Aisha leaves with three concrete actions.

**Resolution:**

Aisha stays opted in—this time with intent. She tells a colleague: "I ignored it for months. Nothing bad happened. Then it was useful exactly when I needed it."

The system didn't punish her absence. It waited.

*(MVP note: do not log “dormancy” or re‑engagement as behavioural analytics. Only system events are logged.)*

**Dormant User Re-engagement Guidance:** When a user returns after ≥2 missed cycles, match notification should include subtle acknowledgment: "Good to see you back" or equivalent. No guilt, no metrics—just warmth.
