# Core User Experience

## Defining Experience

The core experience is the match notification: users receive a match and decide almost instantly whether to engage or ignore it. The critical action to get right is the join moment — in a single glance, users must understand what will happen next, that expectations are minimal, and that non-response is a valid outcome. If the notification feels safe, clear, and low-pressure, everything else follows.

## Platform Strategy

MVP is web-only, surfaced primarily via Teams and email links. The primary interaction mode is mouse and keyboard. Expect corporate browsers, locked-down devices, and accessibility tools; avoid reliance on device-specific capabilities or offline modes.

## Effortless Interactions

- One-click join with immediate clarity on cadence and expectations.
- Zero-thought comprehension of the match notification and next step.
- Automatic cadence-based matching with avoidance of obvious repeat pairings.
- Explicitly neutral handling of non-response (no guilt, no reminders).
- Removal of unnecessary steps: no profile optimisation, no in-app scheduling, no feedback submission, no programme browsing.

## Critical Success Moments

- First-time join: user immediately understands the low-stakes, optional nature.
- First match notification: feels safe, clear, and easy to act on.
- First conversation (or graceful miss): no guilt, no obligation, no consequence.
- First-time success: user sees that nothing bad happens if they engage or ignore the match.

## Experience Principles

- Voluntariness first: invitation, not expectation, reinforced on every surface.
- Low effort is the trust proxy: no prep, no configuration, no follow-up required.
- Privacy reassurance is accessible but quiet: a short “what we store / don’t” link.
- The interface should recede; the conversation is the product.
- Notifications are the product: get the copy, tone, and timing right.
