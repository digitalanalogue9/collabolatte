# UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration

## Inspiring Products Analysis
- Microsoft Teams (trusted utility): predictable behaviour, low surprise, fades into the background; notifications feel routine and ignorable without penalty.
- Calendly (social friction remover): carries the awkwardness of initiating; clear permission structure; one obvious next step.
- Google Search (zero ceremony): minimal UI, no onboarding theatre; you remember the result, not the product.

## Transferable UX Patterns
- Routine, non-urgent notifications with explicit permission to ignore.
- System-invitation framing that removes social risk.
- One unmistakable next action; no negotiation or configuration.
- Minimal UI that stays out of the way of the outcome.
- Background-utility posture: predictable, low-effort, low-attention.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Social network dynamics and performative identity cues.
- Productivity dashboards that imply evaluation or ranking.
- Engagement platforms with loud, celebratory UX.
- Usage-celebration patterns (badges, streaks, gamification).

## Design Inspiration Strategy
Adopt: “trust by boring” utility posture; routine notifications; low-cognitive-load surfaces.
Adapt: Calendly-style permission structure into match notifications; Google-style minimal UI into join flow.
Avoid: UX that celebrates usage or pressures engagement.
Risk to manage: over-boring; maintain clarity with a single obvious next action.
