# Executive Summary

## Project Vision

Collabolatte is a trust-first, opt-in ritual engine that makes it safe and effortless for two strangers inside the same organisation to accept a low-stakes invitation. The MVP is intentionally minimal: one programme, predictable cadence, random matching, and a gentle notification. Success is continued voluntary participation and occasional meaningful connections, not granular metrics.

## Target Users

- Cross-functional individual contributors who want low-effort discovery beyond their team without awkward outreach.
- New joiners (3-6 months in) building an internal map and safe contacts.
- Secondary: hybrid/remote staff whose weak ties decay fastest; sponsors who need a credible, non-surveillance narrative.

## Key Design Challenges

- Trust erosion: any hint of monitoring or hidden data use breaks adoption.
- Ghost town risk: matches feel optional but too easy to ignore; participation silently fades.
- First-move anxiety: users stall because outreach feels awkward or performative.
- Perceived effort: even small friction in join/leave/pause undermines the low-stakes promise.
- Cadence ambiguity: unclear timing makes the system feel random and untrustworthy.

## Design Opportunities

- Trust-first transparency as a core UX surface (plain language, no legalese).
- “Do nothing” friendly states that normalise pauses and missed cycles.
- First-move templates and gentle framing to reduce initiation anxiety.
- A cadence cue that is ever-present but low-pressure.
- Tone of voice that signals patience, not nudging.
