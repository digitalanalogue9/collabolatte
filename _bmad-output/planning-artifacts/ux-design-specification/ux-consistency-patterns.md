# UX Consistency Patterns

## Button Hierarchy
- One clear primary action per screen.
- Secondary actions (Skip/Later/Leave) are always visible and safe.
- Never hide or de-emphasise the optional path.
- Labels are explicit verbs; avoid vague actions.

## Feedback Patterns
- No celebratory success states; keep outcomes quiet.
- Errors explain what happened and what did not happen, with next step.
- Info messages are neutral and reassuring, not alarmist.

## Empty & Loading States
- Empty states explain why nothing is happening and when it will.
- Loading states are brief, honest, and calm.
- Silence is acceptable; confusion is not.

## Navigation Patterns
- Minimal navigation; no persistent side nav.
- Clear “where am I” without deep hierarchy.
- Default to single-screen flows.

## Modal / Overlay Patterns
- Use sparingly; only for true confirmations or essential explanations.
- Avoid interrupting users unless necessary.

## Additional Patterns
- Forms: minimal presence; validation is forgiving and explanatory.
- Search/Filter: intentionally absent in MVP to avoid optimisation pressure.

**Guiding Principle:** If a pattern introduces urgency, choice anxiety, or performance cues, it is the wrong pattern. If it makes it obvious that nothing bad will happen, it is the right one.
