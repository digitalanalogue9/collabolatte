# Desired Emotional Response

## Primary Emotional Goals
- Dominant emotion: relief — easy, optional, socially safe.
- Overall tone: calm, reassured, comfortable; a pressure-release valve, not a dopamine product.
- Differentiator: psychological safety without performance, tracking, or optimisation.

## Emotional Journey Mapping
- First discovery: reassurance, clarity, and a sense this won’t waste time.
- Core experience: low anxiety, clear expectations, shared responsibility (“we were both invited”).
- After completion: quiet satisfaction, mild confidence, no follow-up stress; a “that was fine” micro-moment.
- If something goes wrong: neutral, no guilt; calm transparency (“we missed this cycle, we’ll try again next cycle”).
- Returning later: familiarity, low stakes, trust that nothing has changed.

## Micro-Emotions
Optimise for:
- Confidence over confusion
- Trust over skepticism
- Low anxiety over excitement
- Satisfaction over delight
- Belonging over isolation

Explicitly avoid:
- Urgency
- Gamification
- Performance signalling
- “Programme energy”
- Any sense of being assessed

## Design Implications
- Make voluntariness explicit: opt-in, opt-out, and non-response are all valid outcomes.
- Keep tone low-key: calm, plain language that reduces social risk.
- Use predictable cadence cues as trust anchors (e.g., “Next match: on/around …”).
- Avoid UI patterns that imply measurement, optimisation, or evaluation.
- Treat failure as absorbed by the system: no guilt loops, no “missed match” messaging.
- Visuals should feel quiet: spacious layouts, soft contrast, no celebratory theatrics.

## Emotional Design Principles
- Relief first: every surface should reduce pressure and social risk.
- Calm over excitement: a quiet, steady experience is success.
- Safety without spectacle: trust cues, not trust theatrics.
- Predictability builds trust: stable tone and cadence every cycle.
- The interface recedes; the conversation remains.
