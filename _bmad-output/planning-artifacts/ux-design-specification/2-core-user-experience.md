# 2. Core User Experience

## 2.1 Defining Experience
The defining experience is the match notification as a low-pressure invitation. Users receive a match, decide quickly whether to engage, and then either meet or move on. If the invitation feels safe, clear, and optional, everything else works. The success story users tell is simple: “I got matched with a couple of people and just had a coffee. It was easy.”

## 2.2 User Mental Model
Users currently solve this through ad-hoc intros, Teams outreach, or doing nothing to avoid awkwardness. Their default expectation is “another programme I’ll be expected to participate in.” Confusion centres on expectations, monitoring, preparation, and the consequences of ignoring a match. They love when the system carries the awkwardness; they hate obligation, forms, scheduling tools, follow-ups, and metrics.

## 2.3 Success Criteria
- Immediate comprehension: the engagement decision should take seconds.
- No initiation burden: they didn’t have to reach out first or explain.
- Silence is acceptable: no nags, no reminders, no judgement.
- Predictable cadence: the next match arrives on time.
- Automatic essentials: matching on cadence, clear human wording, avoidance of obvious repeats.

## 2.4 Novel UX Patterns
Established patterns only: opt-in subscription, notification-driven interaction, and link-out to a real-world meeting. The unique twist is what’s missing — no optimisation, no tracking, no performance framing.

## 2.5 Experience Mechanics
**Initiation (MVP):** user clicks “Join.” Nothing else required.
**Interaction:** user receives a message with who they’re matched with, why (briefly), and what to do next (optional).
**Feedback:** implicit; the system behaves the same whether they engage or ignore.
**Completion:** no “done” state — the conversation is the end, and staying opted-in is the success signal. The product fades back into the background.

**Post-MVP variation (programmes):** initiation expands to “Join a programme,” but principles stay fixed: invitation/recommendation first, a calm bulletin-board list second; one-click opt-in and opt-out; no comparison pressure, metrics, or optimisation cues. Adding programmes must not add pressure.
