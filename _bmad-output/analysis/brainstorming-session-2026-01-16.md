# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** {{user_name}}
**Date:** {{date}}

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Marketing website
**Goals:** Define the full set of pages needed; list images required with prompts to generate initial images via AI; draft prompts for initial page/content copy; identify additional recommendations to strengthen the marketing site.

### Session Setup

You confirmed the scope and goals for the marketing website brainstorming session and want coverage of pages, image needs with prompts, content prompts, and additional recommendations.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques  
**Analysis Context:** Marketing website with focus on page coverage, image requirements with AI prompts, content prompts, and additional recommendations.

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Mind Mapping:** Build a comprehensive page and section map with asset dependencies.
- **Role Playing:** Generate persona‑specific page intent, imagery needs, and content prompts.
- **SCAMPER Method:** Strengthen and differentiate pages, CTAs, and prompt quality through systematic improvement.

**AI Rationale:** A structured sequence to ensure breadth (pages), depth (prompts), and differentiation (improvements).

## Technique Execution Results

**Mind Mapping — Key Outputs**

- **Page architecture and intent clusters** captured for the marketing website, with emphasis on acquisition, evaluation, trust, conversion, depth, and hygiene groups.
- **Home page spine** defined and expanded into section-by-section prompts (intent, copy prompt, image prompt, CTA guidance).
- **Security & Trust page spine** sequenced for conservative readers and expanded into section-by-section prompts.
- **How It Works page spine** sequenced for clarity and expanded into section-by-section prompts.

**Role Playing — Key Outputs**

- Personas/reader posture repeatedly prioritised: conservative readers, opt‑in participants, and cautious evaluators.
- Trust-first language refined (consent, boundaries, non‑surveillance) to reduce anxiety and improve perceived safety.

**SCAMPER Method — Key Outputs**

- Consistency pass performed across Home, Security & Trust, and How It Works to remove drift, reduce repetition, and standardise trust language.
- Global image direction aligned to UX theme and palette for cohesion.

### Linked Artefacts (Avoid Duplication)

- Unified prompt pack: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/marketing/unified-prompt-pack.md`
- Logo directions shortlist: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/marketing/logo-directions-shortlist.md`

### Ideas Captured (summary list)

**[Category #1]**: Intent‑Driven Page Clustering  
_Concept_: Group pages by visitor intent (acquisition, evaluation, trust, conversion, depth, hygiene) to guide tone, content depth, and asset needs.  
_Novelty_: Reframes IA around psychology rather than navigation.

**[Category #2]**: Home Page as Compression Layer  
_Concept_: Home acts as narrative compression; section order and prompts built to minimise anxiety and maximise clarity before conversion.  
_Novelty_: Prioritises emotional pacing over feature exposition.

**[Category #3]**: Trust‑First Security Sequencing  
_Concept_: Security & Trust ordered to put emotional safety and boundaries before data handling.  
_Novelty_: Aligns with conservative reader scanning behaviour.

**[Category #4]**: Human‑First Value Proposition  
_Concept_: Emphasise belonging, serendipity, and opt‑in safety before any organisational metrics.  
_Novelty_: Positions the service as human infrastructure, not a programme.

**[Category #5]**: Three‑Step Flow (Opt‑in → Match → Conversation)  
_Concept_: Present the flow as light, non‑technical, and consent‑centred.  
_Novelty_: Reduces process framing to preserve psychological safety.

**[Category #6]**: “What We Do Not Do” Boundaries  
_Concept_: Explicit, unemotional exclusions (no monitoring, recording, profiling) to reduce anxiety.  
_Novelty_: Uses restraint as a trust signal.

**[Category #7]**: Participant‑Norms Safety Framing  
_Concept_: Safety emphasised as shared norms (respect, discretion, autonomy), not enforcement.  
_Novelty_: Keeps trust without managerial tone.

**[Category #8]**: Lightweight Operational Controls  
_Concept_: Balanced control surface (admin/data/participation) presented as proportionate.  
_Novelty_: Signals responsibility without bureaucracy.

**[Category #9]**: Consistency Language Set  
_Concept_: Shared phrases across pages: “opt‑in participation”, “no monitoring or evaluation”, “thoughtful matching”, “minimal, purpose‑limited data”.  
_Novelty_: Ensures calm continuity across user journey.

**[Category #10]**: Monochrome‑First Logo Strategy  
_Concept_: Monochrome lockups to enforce trust, restraint, and portability; colour as optional accent.  
_Novelty_: Protects positioning and avoids lifestyle cues.

**[Category #11]**: 8‑Direction Logo Shortlist  
_Concept_: Eight symbol+wordmark options prioritising soft geometry and connection‑first cues.  
_Novelty_: Ensures favicon‑ready symbols without coffee literalism.

**[Category #12]**: Theme‑Aligned Imagery Guidance  
_Concept_: Image prompts explicitly aligned to UX theme palette (warm neutrals + sage/teal accents).  
_Novelty_: Visual cohesion across marketing and product surfaces.

## Role Playing — Persona Insights (Captured)

### Persona 3 — Internal Sponsor

- **Primary hesitation:** Fear of unintended pressure or “culture programme” optics; concern about consent and privacy perceptions.
- **What they need next:** Clear Security & Trust boundaries; explicit organiser role limits; simple stop/pause assurances; a one‑page pilot frame.

### Persona 5 — Procurement / Risk

- **Primary blocker:** Lack of evidence around data handling, visibility, and accountability.
- **What they need next:** Plain‑English privacy summary; explicit “we do not” statements; named internal programme lead; exit/deletion assurances; pilot scope statement.

### Persona 2 — Sceptical Evaluator

- **Primary concern:** Calm tone without proof; fear of opt‑in sliding into expectation.
- **What they need next:** Explicit boundaries; “what we keep simple” restraint statement; real participant reflections; clean exit story.

### Persona 4 — Participant (Invited)

- **Primary reaction:** Curiosity followed by caution about judgement and real optionality.
- **Safety sentence:** “This is entirely optional, nothing is recorded or assessed, and you’re free to leave or pause at any time without explanation.”

### Persona 1 — Curious Individual

- **What draws them in:** Gentle, human language; opt‑in, no forced socials, small conversations.
- **Bounce triggers:** Programme/rollout language, optimisation framing, staged corporate imagery.
- **Resonant phrase:** “Nothing to prepare. Nothing to perform. Just a coffee and a conversation.”
